- Prepare to explain the AI/ML functionality if questioned
- Document any third-party services used

### Post-Launch Considerations:
- Monitor crash reports and user feedback

- Consider implementing push notifications for processing completion
- Add more audio format support based on user requests
- Consider adding in-app purchases for premium features

## Estimated Timeline
- Asset Creation: 2-4 hours
- Testing: 4-6 hours  
- App Store Connect Setup: 1-2 hours
- Review Wait Time: 24-48 hours (typical)
- Total: 2-3 business days from submission to approval

Remember: Apple reviews can be unpredictable. Be prepared to make changes and resubmit if needed. The most common rejection reasons are crashes, broken functionality, and incomplete metadata.
